Build a Project Management Information System (PMIS) Web App
Project Title:
Universal Project Management Information System (UPMIS)

Objective:
Create a full-stack web application that serves as a centralized Project Management Information System (PMIS) designed to support any type of project‚Äîsuch as infrastructure development (e.g., transformer installation), goods procurement, or small-value local projects. The system should support users from project planning through completion and archival.

Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

Visual or hierarchical task decomposition.

Assign dependencies, milestones, and cost breakdowns.

Project Scope & Deliverables

Define scope and expected outputs.

Attach related documents (PDFs, images, etc.).

Scheduling & Timeline Management

Gantt chart or calendar integration for task tracking.

Support for task dependencies and deadline alerts.

Human Resource & Expert Management

Assign engineers, safety officers, foremen, electricians, etc.

Dashboard for progress monitoring and KPI tracking.

Generate PDF/CSV reports for timeline, budget, or compliance.

Historical Records & Project Completion

Archive completed projects with final documentation.

Generate ‚Äúas-built‚Äù documentation or final completion reports.

üß∞ Tech Stack Suggestions
Frontend: React or Vue.js

Backend: Node.js with Express or Django

Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB

Optional: Firebase for real-time features, D3.js for WBS visualization

üîí Extra Challenge (Optional)
Implement user roles (admin, engineer, contractor, viewer).

Add audit logging and compliance check reminders.

Integrate a bid evaluation module inspired by RA 9184 procurement processes.
